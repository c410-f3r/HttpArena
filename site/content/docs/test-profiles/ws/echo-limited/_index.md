Measures the cost of the WebSocket upgrade itself. Each connection performs the HTTP/1.1 upgrade, exchanges 10 messages, then closes and is replaced by a new one — so the handshake is paid continuously instead of being amortized over a long-lived session.

This is the WebSocket counterpart to the HTTP/1.1 [Short-lived Connection](../../h1/isolated/short-lived/) profile.
